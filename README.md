Hey I'm Benjamin Ibarra, welcome to my Github profile


I'm currently a student at Code Fellows pursuing a career change into software development.
My current goals over the next few years is to become a great coder, graduate Code Fellows, and work my way into Video Game Development.
I've done a few online courses and tutorials on C#, HTML, CSS, & Unity. Now I'm ready to commit and fully delve into the world of coding.
